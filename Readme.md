# FizzBuzz

From Wikipedia "_Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division. Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz"_".

This short program prints each number from 1 to 100 on a new line.
For each multiple of three the program will print "Fizz" instead of the number, for each multiple of five it will print "Buzz" instead of the number. 
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five the program will print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

Example:

```bash
1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
....
```
